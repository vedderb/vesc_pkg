# Boosted Doctor

This is a package for diagnosing/repairing Boosted Board (and Rev Scooter) batteries or for using them with a VESC controller.

The package implements the commands and command parsing for Boosted's CAN communications. Most importantly, it implements the battery ping needed for the battery to stay on for more than 10 minutes without an original Boosted ESC.

This package can be installed on a VESC Express or on an ESC.
