# FLOAT (BETA)
Based on Mitch Lustig's original Balance Package, but specifically tailored for one wheeled skateboards, as invented by Ben Smither in 2007: http://www.robosys.co.uk/

Removes unneeded parameters, adds new features and behaviors, and has a more user-friendly configuration menu with usable default/min/max values and informative Help text.
