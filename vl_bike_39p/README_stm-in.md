# VL Bike 39P STM

This is the bike package for VESC Labs controllers with the 39-pin connector. These controllers include the Maxim 120, Maxim 150, Maxim+ 120, Maxim+ 150 and Pronto.

The package implements the default functions on the 39-pin connector and communications with VESC Labs displays such as the Dash35B. It also implements simple one-click configuration functions for IPM-motors that are using VESC Labs encoders.

This package should be installed on the STM32 on the ESC.
