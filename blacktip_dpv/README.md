## Features

### Smart Cruise Control

The headline feature of this package—Smart Cruise allows hands-free operation with configurable timeout and visual feedback.

**Enabling Smart Cruise:**

- **Triple click while running forward** toggles Smart Cruise on/off
- When active, display shows **"C"** to confirm engagement
- Optionally enable **auto-engage** mode to activate Smart Cruise automatically after maintaining the same speed for a configurable duration

**Smart Cruise Timer Bar:**

- Visual countdown indicator using 8 LEDs at the bottom of the display
- LEDs turn off left-to-right as time counts down, showing remaining time at a glance
- When nearing timeout, display changes to **"C?"**, the scooter slows down and plays a distinctive warning beep

**Speed Adjustments During Smart Cruise:**

- **Long hold (>1s), release, then tap**: Speed down
- **Long hold (>1s), release, then double-tap**: Speed up
- **Short tap (no hold)**: Reset timer only
- **Triple tap**: Disable Smart Cruise

**Smart Cruise Timeout:**

- Configurable timeout period (default 60 seconds, adjustable via app)
- Warning mode triggers at timeout showing "C?" with slowdown to 80% speed
- Additional 5-second grace period to re-engage with any trigger action
- Completely disables if no action taken after grace period

### Triple Click Jump Speed

- **Triple click when stopped** starts the scooter at your preset jump speed
- Default is speed 6 (overdrive), fully customizable via app
- Perfect for quickly getting to your preferred cruising speed

### Quadruple Click Reverse Gears

- **Quadruple click (4 clicks) when stopped** enters reverse mode
- Two reverse speeds available:
  - **"Untangle"**: Slow speed for carefully freeing tangled lines
  - **"Reverse"**: Faster speed for backing out of tight spaces
- Use normal speed shifting (tap/double-tap) to switch between reverse speeds
- Release trigger to stop, double-click to return to forward speeds
- Can be enabled/disabled in the app

### Slow Speed Restart

Prevents unexpected speed jumps after stopping in low speeds:

- If you stop at a speed below your start speed, restart resumes at that same speed
- Ideal for sensitive environments like caves, wrecks, or around marine life
- Shifting to speeds above start speed clears this setting
- Returns to normal start speed behavior

### Thirds Battery Display

Professional dive planning tool for managing battery capacity:

- Hold trigger for 10 seconds to activate (audible warble confirms)
- Display shows three bars representing thirds of remaining capacity
- Audible warning when you've used one-third of capacity
- Perfect for implementing rule-of-thirds dive planning
- Can be reset at any point during the dive to recalculate from current battery level

### Battery Capacity Beeps

Audio feedback for battery level when visibility is poor:

- Enable beeps to hear battery capacity without looking at display
- Helpful in dark or murky water conditions
- Adjustable volume levels (0-5)
- Can be enabled/disabled independently

### Trigger Click Beeps

Training and feedback feature for learning click patterns:

- Each click pattern (single, double, triple, etc.) produces a unique tone
- Single click: 2500 Hz
- Double click: 3000 Hz
- Triple click: 3500 Hz
- Quadruple click: 4000 Hz
- Smart Cruise warning: Distinctive warble pattern
- Helps new divers learn the scooter's control system
- Can be enabled/disabled in the app

### Speed Ramp Rate

Customize acceleration characteristics:

- Adjustable via app to suit your diving style
- Lower values = slower, smoother acceleration (ideal for videography)
- Higher values = faster acceleration (ideal for tech diving)
- Range: 100-10000 ERPM/s (default: 5000)

### Safe Start

Enhanced safety feature preventing accidental prop engagement:

- Detects if prop is blocked during startup
- Stops motor immediately if resistance detected
- Audible beep confirms safe start activation
- Adds zero time to normal startup when prop is clear
- Can be enabled/disabled in the app
- Especially useful when children or untrained individuals might access the scooter

### Bluetooth App Integration

Full access to all features via the VESC mobile app on iOS or Android devices:

- Real-time monitoring of battery, temperature, and RPM
- Configure all settings without connecting to a PC
- Visual interface for speed configuration and feature toggles
- Save settings directly to the scooter

### Latest VESC Firmware (6.06) Compatibility

- Always compatible with the latest VESC firmware releases
- Benefits from continuous VESC ecosystem improvements
- Ensures optimal motor control and efficiency
- Silent, smooth operation with latest FOC algorithms

### Display Features

- Real-time speed indicator (1-9 for forward speeds)

- "C?" indicator when Smart Cruise nearing expiry
- 8-LED timer bar showing Smart Cruise countdown
- Rotating display support for different mounting orientations
- Battery level indicators (full, thirds mode, percentage)
